A fun little project which is also my Personal website.

The website is a Terminal themed website and hope you like it :)



This is also an attempt for me to learn to use Rust+WASM with Svelte. (P.S. : For my usage, Rust+WASM might be an overkill.)

### Credits

This is a project created using the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) template for SPA. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.
